# **Token House Overview**

## Purpose and Evolution

Governance of the Optimism Collective began with the launch of the OP token, and token-weighted voting in the Token House. The Token House works alongside the Citizens' House to govern the Optimism Collective, and is responsible for the governance of the Superchain protocol.

The goals of the Token House are:

- Safeguard the evolution of the Optimism protocol in line with the long term benefit of the Superchain
- Manage sustainable economic policies aligned with the long-term viability of the Collective
- Protect against abuses of power in the Citizens’ House
- Enable network operation to continue without reliance on any individual entity

## Relationship with Citizens House

While membership in the Token House and Citizens' House can overlap, each is designed to balance power in different ways:

- The **Token House** uses token-weighted voting, giving influence proportional to OP token holdings
- The **Citizens' House** uses a ‘1 member, 1 vote’ model, so all members have the same level of influence

Together, these two houses create a governance system that balances the different types of interests in the Superchain, making the system more resistant to capture and more aligned with the diverse stakeholders in the ecosystem.

## **Token House Governance Powers and Responsibilities**

As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of governance proposals.

In its current phase, the Token House is responsible for overseeing the allocation of the Governance Fund and all protocol and governor upgrade proposals, as well as proposing any changes to the inflation rate of the OP Token, in addition to various other proposal types outlined in the [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md).

The Token House is in an initial bootstrapping phase, and will take on progressively more governance responsibilities over time.

### Protocol Upgrades

Delegates have the power to veto decisions about protocol upgrades made by the Developer Advisory Board (DAB). This veto power serves as a critical check on technical changes, with the aim of ensuring they align with the interests of those who rely on the protocol.

### Resource Allocation

Delegates participate in resource allocation decisions, including:

- Approving the Collective Intent, missions, and budget
- Approving Governance Fund proposals

### Representative Elections

Delegates elect members to the Councils and Boards and/or approve any alternative selection mechanisms 

For a full description of the voting mechanics for each of these proposal types, please refer to the [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md). In future phases, the Token House may gain additional governance powers.
