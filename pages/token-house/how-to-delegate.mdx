## **Unlock Your Voting Power**

OP token holders are able to vote on *some of the most important decisions for the Collective.* This empowers one of the Collective's key stakeholders to have a say in the development of the system.

## **Register to Vote**

Register to vote with a single one-time transaction. Here's how to get started:

1. Visit the [Optimism Voting App](https://vote.optimism.io/), connect your wallet, and click the “Delegate to Self” button from the connected wallet profile menu. You’ll be prompted to sign a transaction from your connected wallet.
2. You're now eligible to vote on new governance proposals! Make sure you:
    - Stay up-to-date with new draft proposals on the [Optimism Governance Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/)
    - Check the [Optimism Voting App](https://vote.optimism.io/proposals) for new proposals that are ready for your vote. Your voting power for any new proposal will be based on the total voting power you had at the time the proposal was created. This “snapshot” of current voting power ahead of voting prevents voting power from changing while a proposal’s voting window is open.

## **Want someone else to vote on your behalf?**

If you’d rather not vote yourself in Optimism’s Token House, you can choose to assign your voting power to another community member who will vote on your behalf. This is called "delegation" and the community member that votes on your behalf is called a "delegate." Delegating is easy and requires a single one-time transaction. You can always change your delegate or re-assign your voting power back to yourself at a later time.

1. Visit the [Optimism Voting App](https://vote.optimism.io/), connect your wallet, and navigate to the “Voters” page.
2. Here, you can browse community member  profiles, review their statements and voting record, and select someone to delegate your voting power to. Take the time to review  profiles and voting records. Choosing a good delegate is in each OP token holder's best interest.
3. After selecting a delegate, you’ll be prompted to sign a transaction from your connected wallet.
4. You can undelegate at any time to exercise your voting power yourself.
