# govNERDs Contribution Path

## What are govNERDs?

## Responsibilities of govNERDs

govNERDs are responsible for:

**Operational Support**

- Managing voting cycle announcements for Token and Citizens Houses
- Supporting Retro Funding processes
- Monitoring and assisting with moderating governance forums

**Community Engagement**

- Guiding new delegates through onboarding
- Answering governance questions across platforms
- Supporting projects and teams with governance participation

**Documentation & Education**

- Creating and maintaining governance resources
- Developing educational materials for governance participants
- Improving process documentation


## Who Can Be a govNERD?

This is an open contribution path. Anyone interested in governance and willing to engage in community activities can join the govNERD Contribution Path if they meet the requirements outlined below.

## How to Start?

To begin your journey as a govNERD:

1. **Complete the Intake Survey:** Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10BDGWf2lPCJLHETRvUf7L9DxRycJXDUHarcoTqrM1k8/edit) to share your skills, interests, and experience
2. **Join the Community:** Claim your wannabe-govNERD role in Discord
3. **Complete Day-One Checklist:** Review key documents, introduce yourself, and attend your first governance call
4. **Explore Our Work:** Review the [Bounties](https://www.notion.so/ac3ace1c863845dcb08944b23eed280a?pvs=21) and [Assignment](https://www.notion.so/6c90e4c861214ca09c266dac779050b8?pvs=21) Boards to see contributions across different specialization areas
5. **Start Contributing:** Take on tasks from the [Bounty Board](https://www.notion.so/ac3ace1c863845dcb08944b23eed280a?pvs=21) assigned to you by the govNERDs Lead (availability will vary based on your profile and our current needs)
6. **Join Regular Check-ins:** Participate in biweekly community calls to connect with other contributors

## govNERD Roles

The govNERD Contribution Path maintains a community of contributors in an increasing governance context. Contributors may progress through these roles while developing specialization in operational processes, community support, or education/documentation:

- **wannabe-govNERDs:** New contributors beginning with structured onboarding tasks
- **govNERDs-in-training:** Contributors paired with mentors to develop specialized skills
- **govNERDs**: Contributors retaining institutional knowledge and mentoring newcomers
- **Core govNERDs:** Experienced contributors with house or function specialization
- **govNERDs Lead:** Coordinates the program and liaises with the Foundation

### Progression Between Roles

**Progression Between Roles**

Contributors advance by demonstrating both time commitment and skill development:

- **Duration:** Minimum 2 months in current role
- **Activity:** Meet contribution minimums for two consecutive months
- **Skills:** Demonstrate increased governance knowledge and specialization
- **Mentorship:** Regular participation in mentorship activities

Advancement to in-training status requires demonstrating value and receiving a nomination from an existing Core govNERD. This ensures quality mentorship while maintaining an inclusive entry point
*Note*: The list of available contributions is not exhaustive and may evolve with each season.

*Like all Contribution Path roles, these roles are intended for independent and engaged community members who volunteer to provide their knowledge and expertise to the Collective. These roles come without guaranteed rewards. These volunteers are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any of its affiliates for any purposes.*
