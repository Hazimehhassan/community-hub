2. **Join the Community:** Claim your wannabe-govNERD role in Discord
3. **Complete Day-One Checklist:** Review key documents, introduce yourself, and attend your first governance call
4. **Explore Our Work:** Review the [Bounties](https://www.notion.so/ac3ace1c863845dcb08944b23eed280a?pvs=21) and [Assignment](https://www.notion.so/6c90e4c861214ca09c266dac779050b8?pvs=21) Boards to see contributions across different specialization areas
5. **Start Contributing:** Take on tasks from the [Bounty Board](https://www.notion.so/ac3ace1c863845dcb08944b23eed280a?pvs=21) assigned to you by the govNERDs Lead (availability will vary based on your profile and our current needs)
6. **Join Regular Check-ins:** Participate in biweekly community calls to connect with other contributors

## Task Categories

govNERD tasks are organized into categories to help you find contributions that match your skills:

- **Operational Tasks:** Voting cycle management, proposal tracking, announcement coordination
- **Communication Tasks:** Creating forum summaries, writing governance updates, developing explainers
- **Support Tasks:** Answering questions, helping with delegate onboarding, troubleshooting
- **Documentation Tasks:** Updating guides, creating tutorials, improving process documentation

All tasks include clear descriptions, time estimates, and difficulty ratings to help you choose appropriate contributions.

## Progression Between Roles

Contributors advance by demonstrating both time commitment and skill development:

- **Duration:** Minimum 2 months in current role
- **Activity:** Meet contribution minimums for two consecutive months
- **Skills:** Demonstrate increased governance knowledge and specialization
- **Mentorship:** Regular participation in mentorship activities

Advancement to in-training status requires demonstrating value and receiving a nomination from an existing Core govNERD. This ensures quality mentorship while maintaining an inclusive entry point.

*Note*: The list of available contributions is not exhaustive and may evolve with each season.

*Like all Contribution Path roles, these roles are intended for independent and engaged community members who volunteer to provide their knowledge and expertise to the Collective. These roles come without guaranteed rewards. These volunteers are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any of its affiliates for any purposes.*
