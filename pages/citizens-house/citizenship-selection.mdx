title: Becoming a Citizen
lang: en-US
description: The Citizens’ House relies on the concept of governance by individuals with one vote each. Citizens are meant to represent individual human stakeholders of the Collective':' builders, users, and community members who are aligned with the project’s values and are interested in the long-term benefit of the Collective. This is complementary to the token-weighted voting system used in the Token House.

# Becoming a Citizen

## Registration Overview

If you meet the current eligibility criteria, congrats - you can register as a Citizen for the current Season! All you have to do before you can vote is [get your voting badge](https://atlas.optimism.io/citizenship). 

Eligible chains, apps, and users can register at any point in the Season. This article provides detailed guidance for each group on how to claim a voting badge.

Before registering, it's important to understand that Citizenship comes with responsibilities. Citizens participate in governance votes and contribute to the health of the ecosystem. **There will be no financial rewards or incentives for being a Citizen or voting in Season 8 and beyond** —participation is about having a voice in the future of the Optimism ecosystem.

Please note that Citizenship eligibility is recalculated at the beginning of every Season, and criteria are subject to change. Please also note that for Superchain end-users, registration is limited to the first 1000 Citizens.

## Registration Process for Chains

If your chain is eligible, follow the steps below to get your voting badge:

1. If your chain doesn’t yet have an organization in OP Atlas, reach out to your account manager
2. An admin for your organization needs to visit [atlas.optimism.io/citizenship](http://atlas.optimism.io/citizenship) to designate a governance wallet and receive your chain’s voting badge

## Registration Process for Apps

If your application is eligible, follow these steps to get your voting badge:

1. An admin for your project needs to visit [atlas.optimism.io/citizenship](http://atlas.optimism.io/citizenship) to designate a governance wallet and receive your app’s voting badge

## Registration Process for Superchain consumers

If you're an active Superchain user who meets the eligibility criteria, follow these steps to register:

1. Navigate to [atlas.optimism.io/citizenship](http://atlas.optimism.io/citizenship) to check if your address has met the activity requirement.
2. Make sure you have an email and GitHub linked to your profile (if you're a developer).
3. Verify your proof of personhood through either [Passport](https://app.passport.xyz/)  or [World id](https://world.org/world-id)
4. Designate a governance wallet and register to receive your voting badge

## Other notes

Remember that the same wallet can never be used to receive multiple Citizen badges. If you're an admin for an eligible organization/project and also an eligible user, you can only register in one capacity.

If you change your governance wallet after receiving the Citizen badge, the badge will be automatically revoked and re-issued to the new wallet.

Addresses flagged as suspicious may be required to provide additional Proof of Personhood verification, even if their Passport score is above 20.
